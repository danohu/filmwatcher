Find films that are showing

Get an email whenever a film you want to watch is showing in Berlin.

This is the one-hour-hack version of a service I've been vaguely wanting for years, 'songkick for movies'. I hope somebody will make it for real before too long.

For now, here's the chewing-gum-and-baler-twine version. Change the movies you are interested in, and add email account details. Then put in a cron job to give you weekly (or whatever) emails about movies you could watch.

A bit more on motivation...
I like going to the cinema, but only for movies that are really good.

Popcorn movies I prefer to watch at home on a computer, where I can crank up the speed to make the bad bits less painful.
